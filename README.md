#SaladBar Website
SaladBar is a fictional Cafe that, as the name suggests, sells an array of salads. Their motto is to eat healthy and tasty food. The site's target audience is everyone who wants to adopt a healthier diet, people trying to lose weight and those who want to support local produce and services.
The website is a great place to view the current menus and if there are any special offers on. They will also be able to get in touch to order catering for parties or events.

## Design  
### Colour Scheme
+I chose to use a grey and very light pink for the SaladBar's colour scheme.
+According to Noupe.com,>In summary, grey represents calm, sophistication, wisdom and is of course overarchingly architectural.> which is the kind of positive emotion I am aiming for the site.
+I wanted to use the softness of the lighter hue of pink to evoke feelings of comfort, warmth and nuture.  
### Typography
+I used the Poppins as the main font, with Sans-serif to fall back on, should Poppins not load properly in the
users browser. Poppins is a very popular and trendy font at the moment in web design due to its aesthetic and easy-readability.
